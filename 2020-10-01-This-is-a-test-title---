<p><strong style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Summary for Insta Post:</strong><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Shinzo Abe, the widely loved and longest-serving Prime Minister of Japan recently announced his resignation from the post. From his good relations with other countries including China due to ‘Abenomics’, Japan has gained a lot under his tenure, economically as well as strategically. Yoshihide Suge is set to take over the reins and it will be interesting to see if he can maintain the same level of satisfaction among the people of Japan or not. Read on as we try to analyse the political future of Japan and highlight the tenure of Abe.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Shinzo Abe announced that he was resigning from his post on August 28, 2020. He stated that he was doing so in light of extreme health issues, and apologised to the people of Japan for failing to complete his term in the office and for leaving the nation in a period of political uncertainty. At the age of 65 years, Abe suffers from a chronic condition called ‘ulcerative colitis’, which he was diagnosed with when he was a teenager. It is an inflammatory bowel disease that has accentuated recently, prompting him to take this drastic precaution for his health. He had resigned even earlier in 2007 due to this condition. After this, his new period in the office started in 2012, and he has been loved by his people ever since.</span></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
