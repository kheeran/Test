You are strained. You have to relax a bit

160
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,200
I am relaxed

161
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,200
Marsia, "Come here for a minute"

162
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Sindini is here

163
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,700
.look at this
Ateren? He's very nervous, right?

164
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,300
He needs to relax -
"Oliver" -

165
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,500
!See you later

166
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,900
You have to relax more

167
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,900
Well, you guys. are you ready?

168
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,600
Dear, Aunt "Marcella" and others
They are coming for dinner

169
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,900
Will Oliver have dinner with us, or will he come out?

170
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,200
.I do not know

171
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,800
What a movie star

172
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,900
Yes, these are the Americans

173
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,700
Sparkling wine

174
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,300
.it is late

175
00:16:42,479 --> 00:16:43,679
Do not you think?

176
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:48,179
Do not you think he's rude?
When he says "see you later"?

177
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,279
.arrogant

178
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:52,579
I do not think he is arrogant

179
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:57,700
, Just note, this is how he will deposit us
... when the time comes, with his phrase

180
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,900
."!See you later"

181
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:04,300
At the same time, we will have to embrace it for a while
Six weeks long, is not it dear?

182
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,500
I think he's shy

183
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,373
<i>Enjoy it over time -
What if you hate him over time? -</i>

184
00:17:10,573 --> 00:17:12,373
No, my dear

185
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,300
Take these dishes -
.yes, Ma'am -

186
00:17:20,283 --> 00:17:21,283
<i>..my dear</i>

187
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,300

Play something

189
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,200
I do not want to

190
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,500
why do not you want?

191
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,700
.because I dont want to

192
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,600
Why not go to Moscazano with others?

193
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,100
.because I dont want to

194
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,400
<i>You spoil everyone's fun</i>

195
00:17:58,370 --> 00:17:59,370
!Come on

196
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,700
Play well, darling

197
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,600
.Hello -
.Hello -

198
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,800
What are you doing?

199
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,500
.I read

200
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,300
How can you do, everyone near the river?

201
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,200
I have allergies

202
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,700
.Yes, and I also

203
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,800
Maybe the same sensitivity

204
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,500
What if we and you went to swim?

205
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,900
now? -
Yes, come on. let's go -

206
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,300
Do we have to go right away?

207
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,700
I go to change my clothes -
.OK -

208
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,400
I meet you in the basement

209
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,500
I see you at the bottom

210
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,300
Elio, "What are you doing?"

211
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,600
Read my music

212
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,100
No, you do not

213
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,600
I think, then

214
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,000
Oh really?

215
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,700
What about?

216
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,000
.something special

217
00:21:22,687 --> 00:21:23,700
Why do not you tell me?

218
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,800
.Will not tell you

219
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,300
He will not tell me what he thinks

220
00:21:27,628 --> 00:21:28,656
<i>"Elio"</i>

221
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,480
I think I'm going to talk to your mother

222
00:21:31,859 --> 00:21:33,559
<i>More apricot juice, right?</i>

223
00:21:35,422 --> 00:21:38,522
<i>Thank you, good boy
Thank God you help me</i>

224
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,100
<i>Beautiful</i>

225
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,900
I thought you did not like her

226
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,600
Play it again, okay?

227
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,800
.Follow me

228
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,800
These look different
Did you change it?

229
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,200
I changed a little

230
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,400
Why?

231
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,000
.. I just played just like "was not" will play

232
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,200
"If not in copy" Bach

233
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,900
He plays again

234
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,300
Play what again? -
The thing that I played abroad -

235
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,500
Do you want me to play what I played abroad?

236
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,900
.please

237
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,800
I can not believe you changed her again

238
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,100
I changed it a bit

239
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,400
Yeah! Why?

240
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,200
She has just played the way he plays
"Bozoni" if changed in the version "not"

241
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,100
What would be Bach's problem if he played Bach? -
Bach did not compose this guitar -

242
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,800
.. In fact I am not sure that "Bach" would have written -
! Forget that I have asked -

243
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,400
He is the young Bach

244
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,300
I gave it to his brother

245
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,600
<i>I was very cruel when I said
"I think he hates" Bach</i>

246
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,800
<i>I thought he did not love me</i>

247
00:25:01,231 --> 00:25:02,831
Welcome, Professor

!Hello -
<i>Hello -</i>

.Yeah -

! "Mavalda"

254
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,900
Pretty, right?

255

<i>Elio "?"</i>

00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:02,900
<i>Are you sleeping?</i>

257
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,900
!I was

258
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,400
Hear this nonsense

259
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,300
Tell me what you think

260
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,600
<i>.wait</i>

261
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
What?

262
00:26:12,309 --> 00:26:13,900
.I can not hear you

263
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,200
"For the ancient Greeks," Heidegger says,

264
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,900
Internal concealment establishes a means
, To form what beings

265
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:32,000
Not only in relation to them themselves, but rather
As well as other entities in general

266
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:37,900
In other words, understand not only explain the concealment on
"It basically concerns entity relations with humans

267
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,200
Does this have any meaning to you?

268
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,600
That does not make sense to me

269
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,800
I do not think it would be meaningful to APEC either

270
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,300
Maybe it made sense when I wrote it

271
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,700
This is probably the most nice thing
Someone told me a few months ago

272
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,400
.Nice

273
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,000
.Yeah. Nice

274
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,400
.Come here

275
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,500
What is going on?

276
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,200
Is he trying to seduce her?

277
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,500
Elio, "Have you ever done that before?"

278
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,800
How do I know?

279
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,400
I would like to be in his place

280
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,500
Who would not want to be in place?

281
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,100
She wants it whatever it costs

282
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,600
are you coming?

283
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,100
I'll go later

284
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:02,400
Are you annoyed that you are upset by "Chiara"?

285
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,500
Why should I be upset by Kiara?

286
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,800
.because of him

287
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,700
Because of who?

288
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,000
"Oliver"

289
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,800
Turn on

290
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,300
Will you meet me here tomorrow night?

291
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,850
!Wait for me
!Wait for me

292

.come on quickly

293
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,600
We had sex last night

294
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,200
"Me and Marcia

295
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,200
Why did not you do it?

296
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,300
.I do not know

297
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:19,100
Well, try better than that, do not you?

298
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,000
All I needed was courage

299
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,500
Access and touch

300
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,900
She would have agreed

301
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,400
Well, try again later

302
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,800
Try .. What later?

303
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,400
I have just heard of people in
Sirmione "They found something"

304
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,600
!Fabulous

305
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,800
I go there today
Do you want to come?

306
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,500
.I'd like it. Thank you

307
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,200
Can I go too?

308
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,100
Under one condition to remain silent

309
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,600
Silent Kun has a lot of opinions?

310
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,400
Or just silent in not telling anyone what it is
The wonderful things you dug into?

311
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,900
, No drilling is done to anything
It is what has been brought to the surface

312
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,100
.from water

313
00:32:03,265 --> 00:32:04,265
What are you doing?

314
00:32:04,365 --> 00:32:06,065
I go to Lake Garda with my father

315
00:32:06,065 --> 00:32:08,065
"He wants to see" Oliver
The place where they are swept away

316
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,900
Can you tell him that I have passed?

317
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,300
It is inside with my father
Help him

318
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,500
. I was amazing last night, on the dance platform

319
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,900
He is dancing well -
.Drive well -

320
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,600
It is also handsome

321
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,500
Do you want us to meet? -
.Both -

322
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,100
Hey, enter

323
00:32:48,849 --> 00:32:51,382
It will be a pleasure to meet today

324
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:56,279
Only if you promise to wait for me
We will return

325
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,800
My father always sits in front
With Anges to guide

326
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,000
She seems to have loved you, Sahij?

327
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,900
It looks more beautiful than last year

328
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,900
She saw her naked during a night swim

329
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,900
A great body

330
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,300
Are you trying to make me love her?

331
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,700
What harm in it?

332
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,500
Well, there is no harm

333
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:38,100
I just want to pay attention to these things
Yourself, if you do not mind

334
00:33:43,065 --> 00:33:44,465
I will lead today

335
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,700
Just do not represent the role of a good host

336

<i>.very good
Thanks Angie, you can leave this evening</i>

337
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,900

340
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,200
What? What?

341
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,700
<i>, Then another thousand...</i>

.. "was the name of a poem for" Ctulos</i>

344
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,360
It is for the man himself

00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,600

Who would like to go swimming before we go back?

363
00:36:22,135 --> 00:36:23,735
It is very scandalous

364
00:36:24,434 --> 00:36:26,934
All statues are often of this type

00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,400
Are you going too? -
..Both. I have to stay and work a little in my book -

370
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,850
Your Lord! What about some drink to celebrate the day?

371
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,700

375
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:38,150

Honey, did you see my "Heptamiron" book?

382
00:42:39,321 --> 00:42:41,171
It is in German

383
00:42:46,801 --> 00:42:48,701
I do not remember where we stopped

384
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,750
But I think you will love this.

385
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,500
Come here, darling

386
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,050
If so, I will translate

387
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:12,550
.. Farris is a young man fond of love princess "

388
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:15,350
He is also fond of him

389
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:19,450
Although she does not seem to be fully aware of it

390
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,200
... and against friendship
.. "Freundshavt"

391
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
... which flourish between them, or

392
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,950
Perhaps because of this strong friendship

393
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:35,650
The young knight finds himself

394
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:41,550
.. very much and unable to speak

395
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:46,250
Because he is totally incapable of addressing his love

396
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:51,300
: Until one day the princess asked frankly

397
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,150
<i>Is it better to speak or die?</i>

398
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:12,850
I will never have the courage to ask such a question

399
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:15,750
I doubt that

400
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,400
..Listen
.. إيلي "الجميل"

401
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:27,200
You know you can always talk to us

402
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:36,300
My mother was reading a novel
French from the sixteenth century

403
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,000
I have read a few of them for my parents
When the lights were off

404
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:42,150
Is it about the knight who does not know
Whether he will speak or die?

405
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:43,650
<i>.Right</i>

406
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,380
So, did he or did not he?

407
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:49,880
She said it would be better to speak

408
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,950
But she remained cautious

409
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:57,450
I felt a smell somewhere

410
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:05,700
So, will he speak?

411
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:07,800
.Both

412
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,550
Evades.

413
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:15,400
I thought so
It is French

414
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,900
I have to go to town
A little for some things

415
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,750
I can go
I have nothing to do today

416
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:30,300
Why do not we go together?

417
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:32,600
now? -
.Yeah -

418
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:34,300
.now

419
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,300
Unless, of course, you have more important things

420
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,450
Can I put these in your bag?

421
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:54,650
.Yes please

422
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:07,350
The wheels are fitted and the tires are blown

423
00:46:07,450 --> 00:46:08,600
.Fabulous. Thank you

424

, Yesterday I scratched myself badly

Ankes insisted on treating him
A variety of magic recipes

426
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:20,350
I think he has benefited

427
00:46:44,350 --> 00:46:46,200
Will you hold a moment for me?

428
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:07,200
Do you want one? -
.Certainly -

429
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,200
Not bad, right?

430
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,350
It's not bad at all

431
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,300
I thought you did not smoke

432
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:41,900
.I dont do

433
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,750
It's World War II, right?

434
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:50,700
It is the First World War

435
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:54,050
You have to be eighty
At least to know which one

The battles were deadly during the First World War

If only you know my ignorance
Things that matter

443
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:24,900
What are the things that matter?

444
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,600
You know what things are

445
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,200
Why are you telling me this?

446
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,800
Because I thought you should know

447
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:51,350
Because you thought I should know?

448
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:55,350
Because I wanted you to know?

Do you say what I think you are saying?

Well, does that mean we can
Are we talking about these things or not really?

461
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:40,600
That means we can not
We talk about these kinds of things

462

OK?

463

The water flows directly from there

485
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:40,200
I like the way things say

486
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:42,350
I do not know why you are humiliating yourself

487
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:45,050
<i>If you do not, I think</i>

488
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:51,600
<i>Are you so afraid of what I'm thinking?</i>

489
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:07,300
You make things very difficult for me

490
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:20,100
"I love this," Oliver

491
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:27,200
What?

492
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:32,750
.everything

493
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,100
Do you mean us?

494
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:42,000
It's not bad

495
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:44,450
It's not bad

496
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,750
Has it improved now?

497
00:56:49,008 --> 00:56:50,908
No, no, no

498
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,050
.We have to go

499
00:56:53,050 --> 00:56:54,050
Why?

500
00:56:54,350 --> 00:56:57,000
I know myself, okay?
We act properly

501
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:58,450
We do not do anything shy

502
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:00,000
This is a good thing

503
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:02,300
I want to be good

504
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:03,400
OK?

505
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,400
Do I insult you?

506
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:20,200
Do not just do it

507
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,500
I think he started getting inflamed

508
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,400
Are we passing the pharmacy on our way back?

509
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:34,600
.excellent idea

510
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:45,200
"So we got the government of Bettino Craxi

511
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:48,250
Because we do not do anything but
Speech, speech and speech

512
00:57:48,350 --> 00:57:49,950
Let me talk

513
00:57:50,150 --> 00:57:53,650
We have five parties that do nothing but fight

514
00:57:53,850 --> 00:57:56,650
Drink and be dumb
Let them talk. he and she

515
00:57:56,850 --> 00:57:59,150
I would like to know what they think too

516
00:57:59,550 --> 00:58:02,250
"What do you think?"
A five - party government

517
00:58:02,450 --> 00:58:05,900
Azizi, I think this is a historic compromise

518
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:09,550
.Do not say this
The term "settlement" is tragic

519
00:58:09,850 --> 00:58:12,600
, I have changed since I inherited this place
.... Anilla, "You"

520
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:14,350
What does this thing have to do with that?

521
00:58:14,450 --> 00:58:16,200
What are you saying?

522
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:18,950
You are crazy, my love

523
00:58:19,150 --> 00:58:20,850
You are very funny

524
00:58:21,050 --> 00:58:25,300
It 's right, you' re a fan.
And you do not tell her anything -

525
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:27,450
.say something

526
00:58:27,650 --> 00:58:29,350
You quit

527
00:58:29,350 --> 00:58:32,150
Why do not we talk about the death of "Bonwell"?

528
00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:34,850
Bonoil "was a genius"

529
00:58:35,050 --> 00:58:37,150
Do you know him? -
<i>Cinema is not the solution -</i>

530
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:40,350
, Cinema is a mirror of reality
It is a filter

531
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:44,350
"The specter of freedom has been introduced
..Although continuous boycott

532
00:58:44,550 --> 00:58:46,650
Everyone loves Bonwell

533
00:58:46,850 --> 00:58:48,200
Let's hear his opinion

534
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,750
He does not know anything about Italy

535
00:58:50,850 --> 00:58:53,150
<i>.say something
Your opinion</i>

536
00:58:53,150 --> 00:58:54,500
Do you have an opinion?

537
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:56,750
He is American, my love. he is American

538
00:58:56,850 --> 00:58:58,600
American, but that does not mean he is stupid

539
00:58:58,683 --> 00:59:00,216
<i>My love, he 's an American</i>

540
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:05,950

<i>You lead me to madness
Lead me to madness</i>

544
00:59:15,650 --> 00:59:17,450
What speeches?

545
00:59:18,350 --> 00:59:19,950
What is the matter?
what is happening?

546
00:59:20,550 --> 00:59:22,350
.nothing
This always happens

547
00:59:22,650 --> 00:59:25,850
Mavalda, "Where is the ice?" -
It's in the fridge -

548
00:59:25,850 --> 00:59:27,850
He gets used to everything completely

549
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:07,650
Do not you realize that you are everything?

550
01:00:07,750 --> 01:00:09,500
What are you talking about?

551
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:12,350
No more politics and nothing -
He also left -

552
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:15,300
Elio "?"

553
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:20,500
<i>Elio "?"</i>

554
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:22,600
Are you fine?

555
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:24,660
Sit for a moment

556
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:28,340
If you insist

557
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:35,000
That was not my fault, right? -
.Both -

558
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:38,920
I'm in a mess

559
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:45,300
Well, the kitchen table is definitely as well

560
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:52,820
Ah, where did you learn to do it?

561
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:57,300
My dad used to do this to me when I was sick
Trust me, this helps

562
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:05,580
I had one like this -
Oh really? -

563
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:07,940
.Yeah -
Have you ever worn it? -

564
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:11,180
My mother says we are conservative Jews

565
01:01:12,112 --> 01:01:13,112
.OK

566
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:18,720
I think this is true for your mother -
- Funny funny -

567
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:27,620
She will kill me if she does.
I do not hope this -

568
01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:41,300
Hello, are you leaving?
Where is Elio?

569
01:01:41,620 --> 01:01:44,400
It's inside. His nose was bleeding
At lunch now he is resting

570
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:45,920
Oh really? -
.Yeah -

571
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:48,003
Well, I'll be back in a minute -
!Bye -

572
01:01:48,228 --> 01:01:49,944
.do not go anywhere

573
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:03,200
<i>Are you fine?</i>

574
01:02:10,780 --> 01:02:11,820
Will we get out?

575
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:17,360
I do not know if I can go out
If my mother sees this, she will be worried

576
01:02:17,540 --> 01:02:19,060
Oh really? -
Yes, it's annoying -

577
01:02:25,060 --> 01:02:26,140
Where is Oliver?

578
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:27,520
Do not ask me

579
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:46,720
Where is Oliver?

580
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:50,920
Did not he come out? -
Do not you want fresh juice? -

581
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:53,640
"No, thank you," Mavalda
We'll have dinner soon

582
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:54,760
.There is nothing wrong

583
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:56,260
I'm going out tonight

584
01:02:56,300 --> 01:02:59,340
Do not make me worry -
What are you talking about? -

585
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:01,640
This is not a good thing, madam

586
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:03,140
.Day cares about the same things -
.OK -

587
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:05,600
Why do you reprove me?
I am 17 years old

588
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:07,200
She is worried about you

589
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:14,780
You love him, do not you? "Oliver"?

590
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:17,580
"Everyone loves" Oliver

591
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:19,960
I think he loves you too

592
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:21,680
More than you do

593
01:03:24,180 --> 01:03:25,580
Is this your impression?

594
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:28,680
No, it's the one who told me -
When did he say this? -

595
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:31,240
.Since the period

596
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:58,280
Mavalda, "do you know where Oliver is?"

597
01:03:58,280 --> 01:03:59,520
.I do not have any idea

Do you really read a lot?

609
01:07:43,820 --> 01:07:46,960
I also love reading
But I do not tell anyone

610
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:48,640
Why do not you tell anyone?

611

Who are they?

Are you hiding from what you really are?

617
01:08:06,377 --> 01:08:07,955
No, not with you

618
01:08:07,955 --> 01:08:09,077
not with me?

619
01:08:13,355 --> 01:08:15,100
Well, maybe a little

620

and how's that?

621
01:08:18,355 --> 01:08:20,088
You know exactly what I mean

622
01:08:20,822 --> 01:08:22,111
Why you say that?

623
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:24,177
Why?

624
01:08:26,555 --> 01:08:27,800
..because I

625

.Your silence kills me
I'd rather die knowing you hate me

I am very cowardly

641

This is exaggerated

642

"Brakstillis" and the others arrived yesterday from Berlin "

01:11:06,755 --> 01:11:08,738
We should start by cataloging them

650
01:11:08,963 --> 01:11:10,777
This will keep us busy until lunch, as I imagine

651
01:11:10,877 --> 01:11:11,877
Definitely.

652

Pretty, right?

653
01:11:18,388 --> 01:11:20,500
All of them are incredibly sensual

654
01:11:20,577 --> 01:11:23,711
Because they are more Hellenistic than that
It dates back to the 5th century

It is carved

It is very uneven

664
01:12:31,288 --> 01:12:33,366

01:39:00,368 --> 01:39:01,660
And then what? the canyons?

809
01:39:02,094 --> 01:39:04,588
I suppose you have already given up animals
You know I'm one of them

810
01:39:05,556 --> 01:39:07,433
I'm sick, right?

811
01:39:10,394 --> 01:39:12,446
I wish everyone were sick like you

812

Arjok, do not do that

Do you want to see something satisfactory? -
Arjok, do not do that -

Do you want to see something satisfactory? -
.please do not do this -

815
01:39:18,886 --> 01:39:20,590
Hey! please do not do this

816
01:39:25,200 --> 01:39:26,668
Why are you doing this to me?

817
01:39:27,995 --> 01:39:29,038
What do you do? -
...Just -

818

.you are hurting me

819

So, do not fight

.There is nothing wrong

I wish you would not go

<i>God, we have wasted a lot of days</i>

824
01:40:27,872 --> 01:40:29,123
Why did not you give me a signal?

825
01:40:29,123 --> 01:40:30,582
!I did -
You did not give me a signal -

826
01:40:30,582 --> 01:40:32,580
!I did -
when did you? when? -

827
01:40:33,127 --> 01:40:34,879
, You remember when you play volleyball

828
01:40:35,279 --> 01:40:36,770
And then touched you?

829
01:40:38,382 --> 01:40:42,010
Just to show you that I loved you

830
01:40:42,887 --> 01:40:45,897
.When I reacted as if I disturbed you -
.I'm sorry -

.Excuse me -
.There is nothing wrong -

832
01:40:47,015 --> 01:40:49,010
When I decided to just keep a distance between us

.I do not know

834

I come here for almost hours every night

835
01:41:00,571 --> 01:41:01,789
I knew that

836
01:41:04,575 --> 01:41:07,861
This is funny, I have
... I thought it

837
01:41:08,746 --> 01:41:11,248
Yes, I know what I thought -
!Enough! Enough -

Maybe it would be nice for the two
To get away for a few days, right?

.Fine

I read the book you bought me

..pictures

.Thank you

Did Oliver enjoy the trip? -
Yes, I think he did -

928
01:57:38,620 --> 01:57:40,460
It was a nice friendship between you

929
01:57:42,280 --> 01:57:43,360
.Yeah

930
01:57:49,820 --> 01:57:52,220
.. You are very intelligent to not know how rare it is

931
01:57:54,780 --> 01:57:57,540
What a special thing, what you have been through

932
01:58:00,020 --> 01:58:02,180
"Oliver" was "Oliver"

933
01:58:05,480 --> 01:58:07,360
Because that was it

934
01:58:08,580 --> 01:58:10,140
Because that was me

935
01:58:10,660 --> 01:58:15,100
... Maybe that "Oliver" is very clever, but -
.no no. It's more than intelligent -

936
01:58:17,480 --> 01:58:18,720
.. What was between you

937
01:58:20,580 --> 01:58:23,560
It has all the connection and has no connection to intelligence

938
01:58:23,960 --> 01:58:25,400
.it was good

939
01:58:27,360 --> 01:58:30,040
... and both of you are lucky to find the other, because

940
01:58:31,500 --> 01:58:33,400
Because you are also good

941
01:58:40,060 --> 01:58:41,940
I think he was better than me

942
01:58:43,540 --> 01:58:45,420
I think he was better than me

943
01:58:48,140 --> 01:58:50,400
I am sure he will say the same thing about you

944
01:58:51,260 --> 01:58:53,060
Will he say the same thing?

945
01:58:53,720 --> 01:58:55,620
This is a compliment to both of you

946
01:58:58,940 --> 01:59:00,980
At least I have intuition

947
01:59:02,600 --> 01:59:06,200
Nature has its cunning methods
To identify our weaknesses

948
01:59:08,775 --> 01:59:09,775
...Just

949
01:59:10,800 --> 01:59:14,400
Remember that I am here

950
01:59:20,160 --> 01:59:23,280
At the moment, maybe not
You want to feel anything

951
01:59:23,520 --> 01:59:26,340
Maybe you never want to feel anything

952
01:59:27,200 --> 01:59:28,280
..And

953
01:59:29,440 --> 01:59:32,020
Maybe not with me I want
Talk about these things

954
01:59:32,100 --> 01:59:33,160
..But

955
01:59:34,720 --> 01:59:37,980
Feel, something you obviously have experienced

956
01:59:41,780 --> 01:59:44,000
Listen, you had a beautiful friendship

957
01:59:45,720 --> 01:59:47,640
Maybe more than just a friendship

958
01:59:48,940 --> 01:59:50,340
I envy you

959
01:59:53,340 --> 01:59:56,840
In my place, most parents will hope
The whole thing disappears

960
01:59:57,420 --> 02:00:00,320
.. and pray for their children to stand on their feet, but

961
02:00:02,200 --> 02:00:04,100
I am not the kind of father

962
02:00:06,930 --> 02:00:11,630
We are so hard on ourselves that
We heal faster

963
02:00:11,660 --> 02:00:14,030
Then we get to bankruptcy at the age of thirty

964
02:00:15,600 --> 02:00:19,430
What we have to offer will be less
Every time we start with a new person

965
02:00:21,430 --> 02:00:23,700
.. But to force yourself to feel nothing

966
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,230
.. or that you do not feel anything

967
02:00:27,900 --> 02:00:29,260
!What a lose

968
02:00:37,030 --> 02:00:41,830
Have you talked too much?

969
02:00:43,460 --> 02:00:48,530
I will say one more thing

970
02:00:48,530 --> 02:00:50,400
.. This will settle the atmosphere

971
02:00:52,830 --> 02:00:54,730
Maybe I 've come close to it

972
02:00:55,830 --> 02:00:57,960
But I never got what you got

973
02:01:00,400 --> 02:01:02,660
There is always something

974
02:01:02,830 --> 02:01:04,460
He stopped me

975
02:01:04,930 --> 02:01:06,900
Or just stop in my way

976
02:01:11,700 --> 02:01:13,860
How to live your life is something for you

977
02:01:14,150 --> 02:01:15,150
..Just

..remember

979
02:01:18,900 --> 02:01:21,960
Our hearts and bodies were given to us only once

980
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:24,300
..And

981
02:01:25,400 --> 02:01:28,260
Before you know it, your heart is eroding

982
02:01:28,730 --> 02:01:30,700
..As for your body

983
02:01:31,300 --> 02:01:34,060
A time will come when no one will look at me

984
02:01:35,030 --> 02:01:37,000
So let him approach him

985
02:01:40,460 --> 02:01:41,800
..At present

986
02:01:42,130 --> 02:01:45,130
There is sadness

987
02:01:45,600 --> 02:01:46,930
.. and pain

988
02:01:47,160 --> 02:01:48,460
Do not kill him

989
02:01:50,100 --> 02:01:52,300
He had the joy I felt

990
02:02:04,900 --> 02:02:06,960
